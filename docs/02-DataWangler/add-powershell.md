# Addendum: Powershell for Data Science
In this section you will find some tips for using Powershell for Data Science tasks. Powershell is both scripting and command-line shell which offers powerful commands for performing data conversions, sorting and processing.

## What Are the Advantages?
You can process data from various sources in the terminal console. You can run several processes simultaneously in separate, tabbed or splitted terminal windows.
### Pipelines
With pipeline operator **|** you combine commands into command pipeline.

```
Get-ChildItem -Path *.* | Format-Table -Property name, length
```
The commands are executed linearly from left to right, output is shown in terminal and can be saved to a file. Try to execute the pipeline in Quake console <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (a Terminal must be run before first use of the console in booted Windows).
:::info
You can pipe commands, for example to cmd.exe. Try to enter `"dir" | cmd`, `"netstat -o" | cmd` or `"cmdkey /list" | cmd` into PS.
:::
### Cmdlets
Cmdlets are prepared functions you can simply call. You can pipe cmdlets with the same noun.
:::note
For help on a command use `Get-Help "cmdlet name"`, to download help files use `Update-Help`.
:::
## Powershell Tools for Data Processing
- Powershell works with CSV, JSON and XML formats
### Development Versions and Installation

On W11, you have already installed Windows Terminal and Powershell 5.1 (older stable), which can be run by command `powershell`. It is residing in **$env:Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell**. You can check Powershell version by command `$PSVersionTable`.

You  can install development version into **$env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\7**:

```bash
winget install --id microsoft.powershell.preview
```
You can run this version with `pwsh-preview` command from any terminal.

You can split Terminal window vertically with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> and horizontally with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>.

You can run additional Quake style top terminal with <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd>

### Basic Commands
- `schcm` Show-Command to show commands
- Systeminfo
- Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select description,driverversion

### Cmdlets
- ConvertTo-JSON
- ConvertFrom-JSON

```
JSON format: `
{
“IP_comp”: “160.108.0.5”,
“Age”: 26,
“Name”: “Alice”
}
`

CSV format: `
{
IP_comp, Age, Name
“160.108.0.5”, 26 , Alice
}
`
```
- remove duplicate records
- sort data
- find and replace
- processing more files at once

```
Get-Content "C:\Temp\data.txt" | Sort-Object -Unique | Out-File "C:\Temp\dataout.txt"
```
```
Format-Table Count,Name -AutoSize
```

- What is PSCustomObject?

### Powershell ISE
### Using  Powershell in Examples
- ConvertTo-Csv
- Format-Table ft
- data conversion
