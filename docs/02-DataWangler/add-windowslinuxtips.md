In this section you will find some tips useful to both Linux and Windows users.

## Linux on Windows
You can run Linux apps directly from Windows environment. Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI (WSLg) is subsystem for displaying X11 and Wayland GUI applications.

### WSL and WSLg

Running Linux Apps on Windows.
### Installing Linux on Windows?

:::info Graphic drivers for WSL
You may need an installation of dedicated latest graphic drivers (Intel, NVidia, AMD) for OPENGL support on WSLg Linux

| NVIDIA | https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl                                              |
| AMD    | https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-wsl-support             |

2. Disconnect from the internet
3. Open Device Manager
4. Find the Graphic Adapter, right click it and choose Remove device from the menu
5. Install the latest driver and reboot

:::

You may choose from Linux distributions for WSL. Enter `wsl --list --online`. To install the selected distro (Ubuntu, Debian etc.), open **Terminal as administrator** and enter:

### Useful Apps

Apps for Linux *can* run in window GUI; graphically demanding apps are  slower. Some are reasonably stable, until the window is  resized considerably.

The WSLg mode is usefull for scientific applications and utilities. The ability to run bash commands quickly is great for testing and exploring.


```bash
pip install neuralprophet
```

```bash
pip install neuralprophet[live]
```
