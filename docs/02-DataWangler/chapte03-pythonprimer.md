Fundamentals and practice in Python.
- using Spyder
- run Spyder from Anaconda Navigator

## Functions
- Calling of functions

```bash
def hello():
    """Print "Hello World" and return None. This is docstring, and can be called by help(hello) from the Console."""
    print("Hello World")

# Main program starts here
hello()

```

- this way the function is defined for the Console and can be called again
- sessions
- visibility in current namespace
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> information about function
- function needs to be run to update, saving file is not enough
- <kbd>F5</kbd> to run, <kbd>F9</kbd> to run selected function
