# Dimension of Information
## Abstract

Can we create an abstract model of information, conforming to known concepts of physics?  .

## Measurement and Definitions of Information
- independent and dependent
- linear and nonlinear dependency
- causal and non-causal connections
- correlation and causality

- illustration: growth of information based on observations
- quantum theories

## Virtual and Devised Information

- how are the components of information connected
- dynamics in time and development
- root of information, probabilistic seeds

## Informational Dynamics

- single unit of information and our models
- every abstaction is actually a function
- mathematics, physics and mathematical physics

## Myths and Measurables

- our ideas about volume of information
- transmission and interference
- information forming space, time, and quantum reality
- why there seem to be different rules in quantum realm; macrocosmic and universal scales
