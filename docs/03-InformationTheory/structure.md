# Structures of Information
## Abstract

Dependence and independence of information bits and structures is an important factor in analyzing data and creating insights.

## Types of Interactions
- independent and dependent
- linear and nonlinear dependency
- causal and non-causal connections
- correlation and causality

- illustration: correlation without causality
- phenomenology of empiric research

## Information Cells

- organells of information
- dynamics
- development
- Self correlation of cells of information
- Structures and self evolving systems
- isomorphic behaviour in information cells

## Informational Dynamics

- entropy redefined, measuring a change in a system
- time as a factor of change, speed and structure
- carriers of information
- how to quantize the content?
- chaos and devolution

## Information Theory and Development of Physics

- properties of physical space and interactions
- statistical physics and probabilistic insights
- mathematical models and physical phenomenology
- devising conjectures and concept of information frameworks
