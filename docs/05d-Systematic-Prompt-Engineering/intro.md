## Prompt Patterns and Their Effects

### Pattern 1: The Expert Role Assignment
```
As a [specific expert role], analyze [topic] and provide [specific deliverable].
Consider [key aspects] and ensure your response addresses [specific requirements].
```

#### Example:
EFFECTIVE:
"As a financial analyst with expertise in startup valuation, evaluate this business plan.
Focus on cash flow projections and market analysis. Provide a detailed report including:
- Valuation range with justification
- Key risk factors
- Growth potential assessment
Present your analysis in a professional format suitable for investors."

INEFFECTIVE:
"Look at this business plan and tell me if it's good."

### Pattern 2: The Step-by-Step Framework
```
I need a [deliverable] about [topic].
Please approach this by:
1. First analyzing [aspect 1]
2. Then considering [aspect 2]
3. Finally, concluding with [aspect 3]
Format the response as [format details]
```

#### Example:
EFFECTIVE:
"Create a marketing strategy for a new organic smoothie brand.
Please approach this by:
1. First analyzing the current market landscape and competitor positioning
2. Then developing target customer personas and value propositions
3. Finally, outlining specific marketing channels and campaigns
Include budget considerations and timeline for implementation."

INEFFECTIVE:
"How should I market my smoothie brand?"

### Pattern 3: The Context-Rich Request
```
Background: [relevant context]
Current situation: [specific scenario]
Challenge: [problem to solve]
Required output: [detailed description of deliverable]
Additional considerations: [constraints or special requirements]
```

#### Example:
EFFECTIVE:
"Background: Regional retail chain with 50 stores
Current situation: Experiencing 15% decline in foot traffic over 6 months
Challenge: Need to reverse trend while maintaining profit margins
Required output: Action plan with specific initiatives
Additional considerations: Budget constraint of $100K, must be implementable within 3 months"

INEFFECTIVE:
"How can I get more customers in my stores?"

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Vague Objectives
PROBLEM:
"Give me ideas for my website."

SOLUTION:
"Analyze my e-commerce website (selling handmade jewelry) and provide specific recommendations for:
1. Improving conversion rate
2. Enhancing user experience
3. Optimizing product presentations
Please include specific examples and implementation steps for each recommendation."

### Pitfall 2: Missing Context
PROBLEM:
"Write a business email."

SOLUTION:
"Write a business email to a potential client (enterprise software company) following up after our initial meeting about our consulting services. Key points to include:
- Reference to our discussion about their cloud migration challenges
- Summary of our proposed solution
- Suggested next steps for a pilot project
Tone should be professional but friendly, length approximately 200-250 words."

### Pitfall 3: Lack of Structure
PROBLEM:
"Tell me about artificial intelligence."

SOLUTION:
"Provide a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence structured as follows:
1. Definition and basic concepts
2. Major types of AI systems
3. Current real-world applications
4. Future implications and challenges
For each section, include specific examples and limit technical jargon. Target audience is business professionals without technical background."
